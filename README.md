## Tango

Tango is an open source backend framework closely modeled after Django Rest Framework (DRF), but written and run in TypeScript.

## Getting Started

You can check out the example project in `src/example/` to see how Tango works. I haven't listed this package on NPM yet, so you'll have to clone the repo and run `yarn install` to get started.

After installing, run `yarn example` to run the example app.
