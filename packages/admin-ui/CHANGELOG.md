# @tango-ts/admin-ui

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 2bf9fef: Add `.choices([...])` field modifier (Django's `choices`): pure metadata with no DDL change. The field's TypeScript type narrows to the literal union, serializers reject values outside the set, OpenAPI emits an `enum`, and the admin renders choice fields as selects in both list filters and forms.

## 0.5.0
